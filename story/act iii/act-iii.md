# Act III: The Siege of Estellon

**Goal:** To force the fractured factions into a desperate alliance to save the city from annihilation, uncover the deepest layer of corruption, and decide the ultimate fate of Estellon.

---

## The State of the City

Estellon is under full-scale assault. The internal conflict has left its gates weakened and its defenders divided. Panic reigns in the streets.

---

## Part 1: Army at the Gates (The Two-Front War)

The city is assaulted from both outside and within.

### Front 1: The Walls (The Shield)
Duke Theron's professional, disciplined army lays siege with trebuchets and siege towers. Their goal is conquest.

- **Commanded by:** Brennis and Elara. This is a battle of formations, discipline, and holding the line.
- **PC Role:** Players aligned with them will be on the walls, repelling scaling ladders, manning ballistae, and dueling enemy officers.

### Front 2: The Streets (The Spear)
Gorok the Hillbreaker's bandit horde, aided by Lord Pellor's treachery, has infiltrated through a forgotten gate or tunnel. Their goal is to sow chaos, burn districts, and assassinate leaders.

- **Commanded by:** Kael and the PCs. This is a battle of ambushes, guerrilla tactics, and urban warfare.
- **PC Role:** Players aligned with Kael will be fighting street-by-street, putting out fires, stopping looters, and hunting saboteurs.

### The Reveal
During the chaos, the PCs discover irrefutable proof (e.g., a captured bandit lieutenant, a missive on a commander's body) that Lord Pellor is in league with the Bandit King. He orchestrated the crisis to seize power.

## Part 2: Confront the Source (The Surgical Strike)

The goal shifts from pure defense to a surgical strike. To break the siege, they must cut off the head of the snake inside the city.

- **The Target:** The PCs, likely joined by Kael (and perhaps Elara if they can spare her from the walls), must fight their way into the heart of the chaos‚Äîthe palace district‚Äîfor a final confrontation.

### Boss Fight 1: Gorok the Hillbreaker
The Bandit King is a brutal melee combatant (a Barbarian/Champion Fighter). The fight is a straightforward test of martial might.

### Boss Fight 2: Lord Pellor
The mastermind. When his protector falls, the unassuming chamberlain reveals his true power as a master manipulator (an Enchanter or Illusionist Wizard), leading to a tricky, second-stage fight against magical deception and mind control.

### Confronting Duke Valerius
With Pellor defeated, the path to the Duke's chambers is open. This is a social climax, not a combat one. They find him cowering, drunk, and utterly pathetic. This scene highlights how worthless the title has become.

---

## Part 3: The Abdication (The Legal Transfer)

With the internal threat neutralized and the external attack breaking due to the loss of its leadership, the alliance has won. But now they must face the peace.

- **The Mandate's Purpose:** If Elara's faction secured the Crown-Regent's Mandate in Act II, this is its moment.
- **The Ceremony:** Elara (or the PCs) formally presents the charges against Valerius using the Mandate's clauses for "Failure of Justice, Provision, and Defense."
- **The Outcome:** He is forced to sign a letter of abdication, legally and peacefully ending his rule. If the Mandate was destroyed, the abdication is forced through threat of popular revolt (Kael's way) or a pragmatic deal (Brennis's way).

## Epilogue: The Council of Estellon

The factions gather in the great hall. The PCs, as the heroes of the hour, are given the honour of casting the deciding votes.

### 1. The Fate of Duke Valerius

- **Exile:** A peaceful, permanent removal.
- **Trial:** A long, public airing of the city's trauma.
- **Pardon:** A pragmatic, but unpopular, clean slate.
- **Execution:** A violent, symbolic end to the old era.

### 2. The New Form of Government

- **Reformed Dukedom:** (Lawful) A new, virtuous ruler is installed.
- **Military Stewardship:** (Neutral) Brennis rules as Lord-Protector.
- **People's Council:** (Chaotic) A representative council from all walks of life.
- **Free State:** (Anarchy) Central authority is dissolved.

The DM narrates the future of Estellon based on the players' choices, providing a satisfying, player-driven conclusion to the story of law, chaos, and the weight of the crown.
