# 📜 Prologue: A Day in Estellon

> *"In the morning light of Estellon, three philosophies will collide, and the players will witness the spark that ignites a revolution."*

## 🎯 Session Goals

**Primary Objective:** To introduce the city's decaying state, the three major NPCs, and the core theme of Law vs. Chaos vs. Order. Players will understand the stakes before making their first pivotal choice.

## 🚶‍♂️ Player Hook

The characters are all part of the same caravan that arrived in Estellon the previous evening. They are staying at **The Grumbling Ox** inn in the trade district. They are outsiders—merchants, pilgrims, sellswords—here for the **Sunstone Festival**.

## 🌅 Scene 1: Morning in the Market
### *The Weight of Law*

**🎬 Setting the Scene:**
*"The morning of the Sunstone Festival dawns bright and clear over Estellon. The central market is a bustling cacophony of merchants hawking wares, citizens shopping, and the city guard watching it all. The air smells of spices, sweat, and the promise of celebration."*

### 🎭 Player Introduction
Ask each player what their character is doing in the market based on their role:
- **The Merchant:** Securing a stall
- **The Scholar:** Browsing scrolls  
- **The Sellsword:** People-watching

### ⚡ The Incident
The PCs witness two city guards harassing **Old Thom**, a frail fruit seller. His vendor's permit is a week out of date. The guards, **Rykard** and his partner, are aggressive, threatening to confiscate his entire cart—his livelihood.

### 🛡️ The Entrance of Captain Brennis
The captain arrives. He is calm, imposing, and cold. He listens to the guards' report and Thom's pleas without a flicker of emotion.

**Brennis's Judgment:** 
> *"The law is clear. The fine is five silver. If you cannot pay, the cart is forfeit. You have until my patrol returns this afternoon."*

He states this not with cruelty, but with the absolute, unshakeable certainty of a man who believes the law is the only thing holding back chaos.

**⚖️ Theme Established:** *Order without mercy is oppression.*

## 🌆 Scene 2: Afternoon in the Cobbleward
### *The Cry for Chaos*

**🎬 Setting the Scene:**
*"Later, your business takes you to the Cobbleward, a poorer, cramped district. The buildings lean against each other for support. You see Old Thom again. His cart is still there, but so are Rykard and his partner (Drib). They're back to make good on their threat."*

### ⚡ The Escalation
**Rykard** shoves Old Thom to the ground for "wasting their time." The situation is about to turn violent.

### 🔮 The Entrance of Kael
A sharp **CRACK** of magical energy thumps the dirt near Rykard's feet, kicking up a cloud of dust. All eyes turn to a figure leaning against a wall: **Kael**. They look utterly at ease.

**The Magic:**
- Rykard's sword shreds like paper, and his blade clatters to the stones
- Drib's belt unbuckles revealing his underwear, stopping him from hitting Thom

This is **protective, disruptive chaos**. The guards are humiliated and distracted. Kael catches Thom's eye and gives a slight nod toward an alley. Thom scrambles away but loses much of his stock, urchins scramble to retrieve items of fruit. Kael then vanishes into the crowd.

**🔥 Theme Established:** *Compassion without order is powerful, but fleeting.*

## 🌇 Scene 3: Evening Resolution
### *The Hope for Balance*

**🎬 Setting the Scene:**
*"As evening approaches, you find Old Thom once more, sitting on the steps of a rundown tenement. He looks lost. His means of making a living is gone. The sound of approaching plate mail announces a new arrival. Ser Elara turns the corner, her gaze scanning the area before settling on Thom. She holds a small ledger."*

### 🛡️ Elara's Approach
She walks directly to Old Thom, her demeanor not pitying, but official and resolved.

**Elara to Thom:** 
> *"Master Thom? I am Ser Elara. I've come to rectify an administrative error."*

### ⚖️ Elara's Solution
> *"The fine levied against you was five silver pieces. However, according to the City Charter, Section XIV, Paragraph 3, the maximum penalty for a first-time, non-malicious permit violation is two silver pieces. Sergeant Rykard did not follow procedure."*

She produces:
1. **An official notice of violation dismissal** - "This nullifies the citation. Your record is clear."
2. **Two silver coins from her own pouch** - "And this is the correct fine. The city will pay it on your behalf to settle the matter according to the actual law."

**Final Offer:**
> *"The matter is now closed. However, if you wish to ensure this doesn't happen again, come to the chapterhouse at dawn and ask for Gladys. She will help you file the correct forms for a permit fee waiver."*

**⚖️ Theme Established:** *True law is a shield for the people.*
