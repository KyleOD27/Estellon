# 🏛️ Epilogue: The Council of Estellon

> *"With the city saved and the old regime ended, the PCs become the ultimate arbiters of its future."*

## 🎯 Session Goals

**Primary Objective:** To provide a satisfying, player-driven conclusion where the PCs' choices throughout the campaign directly and visibly shape the future of the city.

---

## ⚔️ The Setup

The external threats are defeated. **Lord Pellor** and **Gorok** are dead or captured. **Duke Valerius** has been removed from power. The factions—bloodied, weary, and forever changed by their alliance—gather in the great hall of the palace, along with key citizens, nobles, and guild leaders. 

**The PCs are given seats of honor as the ultimate arbiters.**

## 🏺 Part 1: The Fate of Duke Valerius

The council must decide on justice for the former ruler. **The PCs cast the deciding vote.**

### ⚖️ The Four Options

#### 1. 🚶‍♂️ Exile
- **Description:** Stripped of his titles and wealth, Valerius is permanently banished from Estellon under guard
- **Consequences:** A clean, permanent break from the past. Prevents him from becoming a martyr. May leave loose ends if external forces try to use him as a pawn later
- **Alignment:** *Lawful Neutral* - Pragmatic and orderly

#### 2. 📜 Public Trial  
- **Description:** A lengthy, public trial is held, airing all of the regime's crimes and corruption
- **Consequences:** Provides catharsis and justice for the citizens but prolongs the city's trauma and division. Could be manipulated by skilled speakers
- **Alignment:** *Lawful Good* - Seeks justice and truth, but is idealistic

#### 3. 🏠 Pardon & House Arrest
- **Description:** Valerius is forced to abdicate but is granted a comfortable retirement under guard in a remote estate. His knowledge of statecraft is preserved
- **Consequences:** The most politically stable option. Prevents a power vacuum but may outrage those who suffered. He lives with guilt but comfort
- **Alignment:** *Neutral* - Prioritizes stability and pragmatism over justice

#### 4. ⚔️ Execution
- **Description:** A swift, public execution for high treason and negligence
- **Consequences:** Provides a powerful, bloody symbol of the old regime's end. Could be seen as tyrannical itself and haunt the new government
- **Alignment:** *Chaotic Neutral* - Driven by vengeance and a desire for a definitive end

## 🏛️ Part 2: The New Government of Estellon

**This is the more important vote,** deciding the city's future philosophy. **The PCs cast the deciding vote.**

### 🗳️ The Four Government Types

#### 1. 👑 The Reformed Dukedom *(Lawful)*
- **Description:** A new, virtuous ruler is installed (potentially Elara, a sympathetic noble, or even a PC). The system continues, but with a just leader
- **Consequences:** Stability and continuity. The existing power structure remains, risking a return to corruption in future generations
- **Who Supports It:** Elara, the nobility, the church

#### 2. 🛡️ The Military Stewardship *(Neutral)*
- **Description:** Captain Brennis (or a similar figure) is appointed Lord-Protector for a transitional period
- **Consequences:** Order and security are prioritized above all else. Effectively a benevolent dictatorship; freedoms are curtailed for safety
- **Who Supports It:** Brennis, the military, fearful citizens

#### 3. 🤝 The People's Council *(Chaotic)*
- **Description:** A representative council is formed from nobles, merchants, guilds, and common folk. Kael (or a chosen representative) holds a seat
- **Consequences:** The most democratic and fair option, but could be slow and inefficient. A true revolution in governance
- **Who Supports It:** Kael, the common folk, the artisans

#### 4. 🌊 The Free State *(Anarchy)*
- **Description:** Central authority is dissolved. Neighborhoods and guilds form loose, self-governing coalitions
- **Consequences:** Ultimate freedom, but borders on anarchy. The city becomes vulnerable to internal strife and external threats
- **Who Supports It:** Radicals, individualists, those who utterly despise authority

## 📜 Part 3: The Final Narration

The DM describes the future of Estellon based on the players' votes.

### 🌟 Example Endings

**Example (People's Council + Exile):**
> *"Estellon enters a new era as a republic. The People's Council, though often loud and chaotic, tirelessly works to rebuild. The stories of your deeds become legend, told to remind everyone of the cost of freedom. Valerius lives out his days in a distant land, a forgotten ghost of a failed era."*

**Example (Military Stewardship + Execution):**
> *"Lord-Protector Brennis rules with an iron fist in a velvet glove. The streets are safe, but quiet. Dissent is not tolerated. The public execution of Valerius is a holiday called 'Justice Day,' a grim reminder of the order his weakness cost."*

## ✨ Campaign Conclusion

The epilogue ends by detailing what happens to each of the three faction leaders and the PCs, providing closure to their personal journeys.

**🎭 The Legacy:** The players' choices echo through Estellon's history, proving that in the end, it was not the weight of the crown that mattered, but the choices of those who bore it.

***"And so ends the tale of Estellon, where every choice carried the weight of a crown, and every crown carried the burden of choice."***
