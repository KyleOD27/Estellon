**Goal:** To transform the players from observers into active participants by forcing them to choose a side in the escalating conflict, forging an alliance with one of the three faction leaders.

## Part 1: The Sunstone Festival

**Setup:** The party is in the market square as the Sunstone Festival begins. It's a defiant celebration, a burst of colour and noise in a grey city.

- **The Calm:** Have each player describe what their character is enjoying about the festival. This builds investment before it's torn down.
- **ðŸŽ¬ The Announcement:**
*"As the sun sets, a town crier moves through the districts: 'Hear ye! By order of the Duke's chamberlain, the unsanctioned Sunstone Festival is prohibited! All gatherings will be dispersed! Public disturbances will be dealt with severely!' You see squads of the city watch, led by the grim Captain Brennis, already moving into position. The festive mood of the morning has curdled into tension."*
 
- **The Storm:** Captain Brennis and a squad of guards, including Sergeant Rykard, arrive. Brennis declares the gathering "unsanctioned" and orders it shut down.
- **The Spark:** The guards begin roughly dispersing the crowd. Rykard shoves an elderly woman. A drunk reveller throws a punch at him. Chaos erupts.
- **The Confrontation:** Kael appears, using minor magic to create barriers of light and gusts of wind to protect fleeing civilians from guard clubs. Brennis locks eyes with them. "Street-Witch. I should have known. Your chaos follows you like a stench."
- **The Player's Choice:** This is the first major decision.
-Do the players:
  - Help Kael create diversions and protect people?
  - Help Brennis and the guards restore order?
  - Try to protect themselves and neutral bystanders?
- **Outcome:** Their actions here grant them their initial reputation with the People or the City Guard.

## Part 2: The Conscription Decree



**Setup:** The morning after, in the aftermath of the riot, the Duke's regime, advised by his Chamberlain (Lord Pellor), cracks down. A harsh conscription decree is announced to fill the ranks and remove "troublesome elements."

- **The Order:** The party witnesses (or is recruited for) a conscription detail led by the odious Sergeant Rykard.
- **The Injustice:** Rykard arrives at a tanner's shop. The tanner, a veteran with a bad leg, offers Rykard his life's savings to spare his only son from conscription. Rykard takes the money... and then conscripts the son and the father anyway for "attempting to bribe an officer."
- **The Crisis:** Ser Elara, who is overseeing the operation, witnesses this. She is faced with an impossible choice: obey her orders and allow this injustice, or intervene and defy the chain of command.
- **The Player's Choice:** Do the players:
  - Support Elara as she intervenes to stop Rykard?
  - Side with Rykard, enforcing the decree as written?
  - Attempt to find a third way (e.g., distracting Rykard, hiding the family)?
- **Outcome:** This choice solidifies their alignment. Supporting Elara aligns them with Reform. Supporting Rykard aligns them with the City. A third way may mark them as Neutrals.

## Part 3: The Aftermath & The Offer

**Setup:** The party is sought out by the faction they most aided.

### If they aided Kael
They are brought to a hidden safehouse in the sewers or a dilapidated tenement. Kael is nursing a wound but is defiant. "You saw what they did. They won't stop. We have to make them stop. Are you with us?"

### If they aided Elara
They are called to the paladin chapterhouse. Elara is troubled but resolute. "What happened today was not law; it was tyranny. The system is sick, but it can be healed from within. I need allies who believe in true justice. Will you help me?"

### If they aided the City/Brennis
They are summoned to the barracks. Brennis is grim. "You understand the need for order in the face of chaos. The city is fraying. I need capable hands to help me hold it together. Can I count on you?"

### The Neutral Path
If they remained neutral, a representative from a merchant's guild or another independent party might approach them with a paid job, setting them on a mercenary path.

### The Hook
The faction leader gives them their first proper quest, pulling them into the growing war.

- **Kael:** "We need to hit their coffers. Sabotage the tax collector's carriage on the main road tomorrow."
- **Elara:** "Rykard must be stopped. Find evidence of his corruption. He frequents a vile tavern called The Rusty Nail."
- **Brennis:** "The rebels are getting bold. Their agitators are spreading pamphlets in the market. Find the printing press and shut it down."
