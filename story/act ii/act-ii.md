# Act II: The Faction War

**Goal:** To escalate the conflict from street skirmishes to a cold war, with the players' actions directly influencing the balance of power in Estellon. The act culminates in a race for a powerful artifact that decides the next phase of the conflict.

## The State of the City

The Sunstone Festival Riot and Conscription Crisis have shattered the fragile peace. Estellon is now divided:

- **Kael's Rebels** operate from the shadows in the Cobbleward.
- **Ser Elara's Reformers** work within the system, rallying disillusioned nobles and clerics.
- **Captain Brennis's Guard** enforces a tense, oppressive order.
- **The common citizens** are caught in the middle, fearful and desperate.

## Core Mechanics: Progress Tracks & The Faction Turn

### Progress Tracks
Three scores (0-10) measure each faction's strength:

- **Revolutionary Zeal (Kael):** Morale and public support for rebellion.
- **Coalition Strength (Elara):** Political and institutional support for reform.
- **City Control (Brennis):** The Guard's grip on the streets and citizen fear.

### The Faction Turn
At the start of each session, the DM narrates how the conflict evolved since the last one, adjusting the Progress Tracks based on off-screen events. 

*Example:* "While you were investigating the tax records, Kael's rebels raided a guard post (+1 Zeal), but Brennis tightened curfews in response (+1 Control)."

## Structure: Missions and Leader Quests

Act II is structured around missions given by the party's chosen faction leader. Each mission has two layers:

1. **Main Objective:** The immediate goal (e.g., steal plans, protect a witness).
2. **Bonus Objective (Leader Quest):** A task that advances the leader's personal 3-step quest chain, ultimately empowering them for the final conflict.

## Example Missions

### For Kael's Rebels (Goal: Increase Zeal)
- **Mission:** Ambush a tax collector's carriage.
- **Main Objective:** Seize the tax ledger.
- **Bonus Objective (Step 1: Secure a Smith):** The carriage is being guarded by the city smith, Borin, who is sympathetic but forced to work for the guard. Convince him to defect and come with you.
- **Outcome:** Success on the main objective grants +2 Zeal. Success on the bonus objective marks 1/3 on Kael's Quest Chain.

### For Elara's Reformers (Goal: Increase Coalition)
- **Mission:** Discredit a corrupt official.
- **Main Objective:** Find proof of embezzlement.
- **Bonus Objective (Step 2: The Church's Blessing):** The official is protected by a corrupt cleric. Exposing him could sway the high priestess to your cause.
- **Outcome:** Success grants +2 Coalition and 2/3 on Elara's Quest Chain.

### For Brennis's Guard (Goal: Increase Control)
- **Mission:** Hunt a rebel agitator.
- **Main Objective:** Capture the agitator.
- **Bonus Objective (Step 3: The Old Soldier):** The agitator is hiding in the district of a retired, respected guard captain. Successfully resolving the situation without violence could earn the captain's respect and bring him back to service.
- **Outcome:** Success grants +2 Control and 3/3 on Brennis's Quest Chain (he is now Empowered).

## The Climax: The Mandate Reveal & The Vault Showdown

- **The Trigger:** The moment any Progress Track hits 7, the faction has become too powerful to ignore.
- **The Revelation:** Lord Pellor, in a panic, publicly reveals the existence of the Crown-Regent's Mandate—an ancient legal document that can legally depose the Duke—hidden in the Vault of Founding. He hopes the factions will destroy each other fighting over it.
- **The Race:** All three factions race to the vault simultaneously. A tense, three-way standoff occurs.
- **The Ultimate Choice:** The players must choose which faction to help in the ensuing battle. This decision cements their final allegiance.
- **The Twist:** As the battle for the Mandate concludes, the external armies of the Bandit King Gorok and Duke Theron attack Estellon's undefended walls. The internal conflict has left the city utterly vulnerable.
The players must now deal with this enemy.

## Act II Conclusion

The winner of the vault battle holds a symbolic victory, but it is instantly rendered meaningless by the overwhelming external threat. The ideological war is now a fight for survival, forcing the bitter rivals to consider an unthinkable alliance. This sets the stage for Act III: The Siege.
