# 🎲 Game Overview: Core Mechanics

> *"This framework is designed to make political intrigue tangible and engaging, turning philosophical debates into measurable game mechanics with clear consequences."*

---

## 📊 1. Progress Tracks (The Faction War)

### 🎯 What it is
Three scores (0-10) that measure the city's balance of power.

#### 🔥 Revolutionary Zeal 
- **Who:** Kael's rebellion 
- **Measures:** Public support and revolutionary fervor
- **High Score Effects:** Riots, civil disobedience, underground networks grow

#### 🛡️ City Control
- **Who:** Captain Brennis's guard
- **Measures:** Order, fear, and authoritarian grip
- **High Score Effects:** Curfews, checkpoints, oppressive patrols

#### ⚖️ Coalition Strength
- **Who:** Elara's reformers
- **Measures:** Political and institutional support
- **High Score Effects:** Legal challenges, noble backing, church support

### ⚙️ How it works
- **Mission Success/Failure** modifies these tracks (+1 to +3 typically)
- **🚨 Critical Threshold:** When any track hits **7**, Lord Pellor panics and reveals the **Crown-Regent's Mandate**, triggering the final race of Act II
- **Dynamic Balance:** As one faction rises, others may react and counter

### 🎭 DM Use
The current scores dictate:
- **City Mood** - Tense, hopeful, fearful, or chaotic
- **Random Encounters** - Protests, guard patrols, or political rallies
- **NPC Attitudes** - How citizens and officials react to the PCs

## 🎭 2. Dialogue Bingo Card (Roleplaying Incentive)

### 📝 What it is
A player handout with phrases aligned to different philosophical viewpoints:

#### 🛡️ Lawful Good Examples
- *"Justice must be served, but with mercy."*
- *"The law exists to protect the innocent."*
- *"We must do what is right, not what is easy."*

#### 🔥 Chaotic Good Examples  
- *"Sometimes you have to break unjust laws."*
- *"The people matter more than the system."*
- *"Freedom is worth fighting for."*

#### ⚖️ Lawful Neutral Examples
- *"Order must be maintained at all costs."*
- *"The procedure exists for a reason."*
- *"Stability benefits everyone."*

#### 🤝 Neutral/Pragmatic Examples
- *"What's the practical solution here?"*
- *"Every choice has consequences."*
- *"Sometimes compromise is necessary."*

### ⚙️ How it works
- **✅ Single Use:** Player uses a phrase well → **Small bonus** (Inspiration, +1 to a Faction Track)
- **🎯 Bingo! (Complete a row/column)** → **Potent Favor** (free healing, key information, temporary immunity from that faction)

### 🎪 Goal
Encourages players to engage with the campaign's philosophical themes through roleplay while providing mechanical benefits.

## ⭐ 3. Faction Leader Quest Chains

### 🎯 What it is
Each faction leader has a unique **3-step personal quest** that runs parallel to the main story.

#### 🔥 Kael's Quest Chain Example
1. **Secure a Smith** - Convince Borin to join the revolution
2. **Rally the Workers** - Unite the guilds under revolutionary banner  
3. **Arm the People** - Establish weapon caches throughout the Cobbleward

#### 🛡️ Elara's Quest Chain Example
1. **The Church's Ear** - Gain audience with the High Priestess
2. **Noble Backing** - Convince key lords to support reform
3. **Legal Precedent** - Discover ancient laws supporting change

#### ⚔️ Brennis's Quest Chain Example
1. **Veteran Loyalty** - Recruit retired guard captains
2. **Intelligence Network** - Establish informants in all districts
3. **Military Precision** - Organize the guard into elite units

### ⚙️ How it works
- **Dual Objectives:** Missions have a **Main Goal** (affects Progress Tracks) + **Bonus Objective** (advances Leader Quest)
- **Empowerment:** Completing all 3 steps before the Mandate is revealed **"empowers"** the leader
- **Final Siege Benefits:** Empowered leaders gain powerful abilities:
  - **Kael** can heal allies with revolutionary fervor
  - **Elara** grants divine protection to the righteous
  - **Brennis** boosts ally coordination and tactics

### 🎪 Goal
Provides long-term personal investment in faction leaders alongside the main political story.

## 🌍 4. The Faction Turn

### 🎭 What it is
A **narrative tool** to make the city feel alive and reactive to player actions.

### ⚙️ How it works
At the **start of each session**, the DM briefly narrates what the **two other factions** have been doing off-screen, adjusting their Progress Tracks accordingly.

### 📚 Example Faction Turns

**🔥 Revolutionary Activity:**
> *"While you were investigating the tax records, Kael's rebels successfully raided a guard post, freeing several arrested protesters. (+1 Revolutionary Zeal)"*

**🛡️ Guard Response:**
> *"In response to the raid, Captain Brennis tightened curfews and doubled patrols in the Cobbleward. (+1 City Control)"*

**⚖️ Political Maneuvering:**
> *"Ser Elara used the chaos to meet privately with several guild leaders, gaining their cautious support for reform. (+1 Coalition Strength)"*

### 🎪 Benefits
- **Living World:** City reacts to PC actions
- **Pacing Control:** Keeps all factions relevant
- **Narrative Flow:** Seamlessly advances background conflicts

## 🏛️ 5. The Ultimate Choice & The Council Vote

### ⚔️ The Mandate Showdown
**When:** End of Act II  
**Decision:** Players must definitively choose which faction to help in the **three-way battle** for the Crown-Regent's Mandate  
**Stakes:** This choice cements their final allegiance and determines which philosophy they believe should triumph

### 🗳️ The Epilogue Vote
**When:** After the final battle  
**Power:** The players become the **ultimate arbiters** of Estellon's future  
**Decisions:**
1. **⚖️ The fate of Duke Valerius** - Exile, Trial, Pardon, or Execution
2. **🏛️ The form of the new government** - Reformed Dukedom, Military Stewardship, People's Council, or Free State

### 🎯 Goal
Makes the players' choices the **driving force** behind the campaign's conclusion, ensuring their actions throughout the entire campaign matter in the final outcome.

### 🌟 Player Agency
- **Every major choice** has been tracked and remembered
- **Faction relationships** influence the final council
- **Personal bonds** with leaders affect available options
- **The ending** is entirely determined by player values and decisions
