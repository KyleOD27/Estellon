# Game Overview

## 1. Progress Tracks (The Faction War)

### What it is
Three scores (0-10) that measure the city's balance of power.

- **Revolutionary Zeal:** The strength of Kael's rebellion and public support.
- **City Control:** Captain Brennis's grip on order and fear.
- **Coalition Strength:** Elara's political and institutional support.

### How it works
- PC mission success/failure modifies these tracks.
- **Critical Threshold:** When any track hits 7, Lord Pellor panics and reveals the Crown-Regent's Mandate, triggering the final race of Act II.

### DM Use
The current scores dictate the city's mood, random encounters, and NPC attitudes.

## 2. Dialogue Bingo Card (Roleplaying Incentive)

### What it is
A player handout with phrases aligned to Lawful Good, Chaotic Good, Lawful Neutral, and neutral/pragmatic viewpoints.

### How it works
- **Single Use:** A player uses a phrase well → small bonus (Inspiration, +1 to a Faction Track).
- **Bingo! (Complete a row/column)** → Potent Favor (e.g., free healing, key information, temporary immunity from that faction).

### Goal
Encourages players to engage with the campaign's philosophical themes through roleplay.

## 3. Faction Leader Quest Chains

### What it is
Each faction leader (Kael, Elara, Brennis) has a unique 3-step personal quest.

### How it works
- Missions often have a Main Goal (affects Progress Tracks) and a Bonus Objective (advances the Leader Quest).
- Completing all 3 steps before the Mandate is revealed "empowers" the leader, granting them a powerful new ability for the final siege (e.g., Kael can heal allies, Brennis boosts ally AC).

### Goal
Provides a long-term personal goal alongside the main story.

## 4. The Faction Turn

### What it is
A narrative tool to make the city feel alive.

### How it works
At the start of each session, the DM briefly narrates what the two other factions have been doing off-screen, adjusting their Progress Tracks up or down accordingly.

### Example
"While you were investigating the tax records, Kael's rebels successfully raided a guard post (+1 Zeal), but Captain Brennis tightened curfews in response (+1 Control)."

## 5. The Ultimate Choice & The Council Vote

- **The Mandate Showdown:** At the end of Act II, players must definitively choose which faction to help in the three-way battle for the Mandate.
- **The Epilogue Vote:** After the final battle, the players decide Estellon's fate by voting on:
  1. The fate of Duke Valerius.
  2. The form of the new government.

### Goal
Makes the players' choices the driving force behind the campaign's conclusion.
