# Gorok Voice Script

## Character Voice Notes
Rumbling voice with hill country accent. Speaks rarely, never wastes words.

## Short Quote (for quick sample)
I make no pretty speeches about justice. I take what I want from those too weak to stop me.

## Extended Quote (for longer sample)
Strength is the only true law. Those too weak to defend what they have don't deserve to keep it.
