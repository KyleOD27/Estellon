## Voice Notes
Start with town crier voice, then shift to dramatic narrator for tension.

## Full Text
As the sun sets, a town crier moves through the districts: 'Hear ye! By order of the Duke's chamberlain, the unsanctioned Sunstone Festival is prohibited! All gatherings will be dispersed! Public disturbances will be dealt with severely!' 
        
        You see squads of the city watch, led by the grim Captain Brennis, already moving into position. The festive mood of the morning has curdled into tension.
