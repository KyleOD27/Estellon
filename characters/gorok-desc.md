# Gorok the Hillbreaker

He filled doorways like a landslide fills valleys—completely, violently, and with the promise that nothing would ever be the same afterward. Gorok the Hillbreaker stood nearly seven feet in his bare feet, and every inch of that towering frame was carved from muscle, scar tissue, and the kind of bone-deep menace that made seasoned warriors reconsider their career choices. At forty-five, he had spent the better part of three decades turning the northern hills into his personal kingdom, and his body bore the accumulated evidence of every brutal lesson that rise to power had required.

His face was a topographical map of violence—craggy features hewn by fists and blades, marked by the white lines of old cuts and the purple discoloration of bones that had healed crooked. His skull was shaved clean, revealing a scalp crossed by scars that told stories of battles won through sheer, bloody-minded refusal to fall. His beard, iron-grey shot through with black, was braided with small bones and metal trinkets—trophies torn from the dead, each one a victory, a conquest, a moment when he had proven himself stronger than whatever poor fool had stood against him.

But it was his eyes that truly marked him as something beyond mere bandit or brigand. Deep-set beneath heavy brows, they burned with an intelligence that was all the more dangerous for being utterly pragmatic. These were not the eyes of a mindless brute, but of a predator who had learned to think three moves ahead, who understood that true power came not just from the strength of your sword arm but from the loyalty of those who wielded swords beside you. They held a cold amusement, as if he found the very concept of civilization—with its laws and customs and pretensions—to be an elaborate joke being played on people too weak to take what they wanted.

His voice, when he chose to use it, rumbled up from his chest like distant thunder, carrying the accent of the hill country but shaped by years of command. He spoke rarely and never wasted words, having learned that silence often accomplished more than speech, that the threat of violence was frequently more effective than violence itself. When he did speak, lesser men listened, not just because of his size or his reputation, but because he possessed that rarest of gifts among violent men: the ability to inspire absolute loyalty in those who followed him.

The armor he wore was a patchwork testament to his conquests—pieces of fine plate mail taken from fallen knights, reinforced leather stripped from the bodies of scouts, chain links hammered back together after being torn apart in battle. Nothing matched, nothing gleamed, but every piece had been chosen for function over form, protection over appearance. At his side hung a massive two-handed sword that looked like it had been forged in some barbaric age—pitted and stained, its edge maintained with religious devotion, its weight such that most men could barely lift it, let alone wield it with the casual competence Gorok displayed.

He moved with the deceptive grace of a hunting cat, all controlled power and coiled readiness. Despite his size, he could cross a room in absolute silence when he chose to, could strike with the sudden violence of an avalanche. His presence seemed to change the very air around him, charging it with the potential for eruption, making even brave men suddenly conscious of their own mortality.

Yet for all his savage reputation, there was an unexpected honor in him—the honor of the predator who did not pretend to be anything other than what he was. He made no speeches about justice or law, claimed no divine mandate, wrapped his ambitions in no pretty lies. He wanted power, territory, wealth, and he was willing to take them from anyone too weak to stop him. In a world full of corruption disguised as virtue, there was something almost refreshing about his brutal honesty.

His followers—hundreds of them now, drawn from the dispossessed, the outcast, the genuinely vicious—would follow him into the jaws of hell itself, not because they loved him but because they feared and respected him in equal measure. He had given them something precious: purpose, direction, and the promise that if they stood with him, they would never want for anything they were strong enough to take.

He was chaos given form, the barbarian at the gates who reminded civilized men that all their laws and customs were ultimately just polite agreements that meant nothing when faced with someone willing to ignore them entirely. And in the dying light of Estellon's corruption, he represented something terrifying: the possibility that perhaps the time for such agreements was coming to an end.
