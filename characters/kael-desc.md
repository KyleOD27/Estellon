# Kael

She moved through the crowded Cobbleward like wildfire through dry timber—swift, unpredictable, and leaving sparks in her wake. At twenty-two, Kael carried herself with the restless energy of someone who had learned too young that stillness meant vulnerability, that safety was a luxury the poor could not afford. There was something almost feral about her grace, the way she seemed to flow around obstacles rather than confront them, always ready to bolt or strike as the moment demanded.

Her appearance was a study in contrasts that perfectly embodied the chaos she championed. Auburn hair, wild and unbound, caught the light like burnished copper, framing a face that could have been carved from marble were it not so alive with expression. Her features were sharp and mobile—high cheekbones that spoke of hunger weathered with dignity, a mouth that curved naturally toward either a grin or a snarl, and eyes the color of storm clouds that seemed to crackle with barely contained electricity.

Those eyes were perhaps her most arresting feature, grey-blue like the sky before lightning, and they held depths that seemed far too old for her years. They were the eyes of someone who had seen too much, felt too deeply, and refused to look away from the world's cruelties. When she laughed—which she did often and with genuine warmth—those eyes would light up like stars breaking through clouds. When she was angry, they grew cold as winter stone, and wise people learned to step aside.

The clothes she wore were practical street attire, patched and mended with the skill of someone who understood that nothing could be wasted. Her hands, quick and clever, bore the calluses of honest work alongside newer scars that spoke of more dangerous pursuits. But it was the way the very air seemed to shimmer around her that truly set her apart—a subtle distortion that made candle flames flicker without wind, made shadows dance at the corner of one's vision.

Her magic was not the controlled, scholarly power of academy wizards, but something raw and primal that responded to her emotions like a tuning fork to sound. When she was passionate—which was often—small objects near her would tremble, and those with sensitivity to such things could feel the electricity in the air, could taste the copper-bright tang of sorcery held barely in check. It was beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, like watching lightning decide where to strike.

To the downtrodden of the Cobbleward, she was a beacon of hope, the girl who had stood up to guards and lived to tell the tale. She had a way of making even the most beaten-down citizen feel like they mattered, like their suffering was seen and their anger justified. Her voice, when raised in defiance or comfort, could cut through despair like a blade through silk. She spoke their language—not the formal words of nobles, but the rough poetry of the streets, seasoned with wit sharp enough to draw blood.

Yet those who knew her best could see the cracks in her armor, the way her smile sometimes became too bright, too fierce, as if she were holding back darker thoughts. In quiet moments, when she thought no one was watching, her face would grow still and haunted, and the weight of all she carried—the expectations of the desperate, the memory of her father's broken form, the constant fear that her power might hurt those she sought to protect—would settle on her shoulders like a cloak made of lead.

She was revolution incarnate, beautiful and dangerous and utterly uncompromising, a living reminder that sometimes the only response to an unjust world was to set it ablaze and dance in the firelight.
