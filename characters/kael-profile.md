## Core Identity: The People's Champion

- **Driving Belief:** The system is a weapon designed to crush the poor and protect the powerful. It must be shattered, not reformed.
- **Core Motivation:** A white-hot, personal hatred for Sergeant Rykard, the man who brutalized her family, and a deep contempt for Captain Brennis, who enabled it by hiding behind "just following orders."
- **Greatest Strength:** Fierce loyalty to the downtrodden, incredible adaptability, and a powerful, unpredictable magic that embodies her spirit.
- **Fatal Flaw:** All-consuming rage that often overrules strategy. She believes any structure is inherently oppressive, making it difficult to build a sustainable future.

## Background: The Spark of Rebellion

- **Origin:** Grew up in the Cobbleward district. Her parents were clever, kind artisans (a cobbler and a seamstress).
- **The Incident:** When Kael was 12, a tax collection turned violent. Sergeant Rykard shoved her father. In a burst of terrified, nascent magic, Kael's power erupted—a concussive wave of force that injured Rykard and shattered the shop window.
- **The Injustice:** Captain Brennis arrived. He saw only a magical threat and a guard injured. In the ensuing chaos, Kael's father was crippled. Brennis upheld the law coldly: the family was fined into ruin. Rykard received a light reprimand. Brennis's contemptible inaction—his choice to value procedure over people—is what cemented Kael's hatred for the entire system.
- **Her Power:** Her Wild Magic is a manifestation of her trauma and her spirit—uncontrollable, emotional, and powerful. It refuses to be constrained by the rules of wizardry.

## Personality & Demeanor

### In Public
A charismatic firebrand and a protective spirit. To the common folk, she is a folk hero—the "Cobbleward Ghost" who shames the powerful and helps the helpless.

### In Private
Haunted and angry. The cheerful rebel persona is a mask for a deep well of pain and fury focused on Rykard.

### Relationships

- **Rykard:** Pure, undiluted hatred. He is the physical embodiment of the cruelty she fights. Her primary goal is to see him utterly broken.
- **Brennis:** Seething contempt. She sees him as a coward who uses the law as a shield for his moral weakness. His inaction is as guilty as Rykard's action.
- **Elara:** Sees her as a "tame" pawn of the system, a hypocrite who polishes her chains.
- **The PCs:** She will appeal to their compassion and sense of outrage. She values action over words.

## Roleplaying Notes

- **Speech:** Quick, sharp, and laced with cynicism and wit. Uses slang and street talk.
- **What She Values:** Freedom, action, compassion, the people.
- **What She Despises:** Authority, bureaucracy, greed, cruelty, Rykard, Brennis.
- **The DM's Hook:** Kael is the source of missions involving sabotage, theft, and guerrilla tactics. Her quests are about direct action and protecting the vulnerable.

## Goals & Secrets

- **Short-Term Goal:** Protect the Cobbleward and make Rykard pay for his crimes.
- **Long-Term Goal:** Spark a full-scale popular uprising to tear down the entire ruling structure of Estellon.
- **Secret:** She is terrified of her own power. The memory of her magic harming someone haunts her. She fears losing control.
- **Secret:** Beneath the rage, she is deeply afraid of failing the people who look up to her.

This refined profile sharpens Kael's motivations, making her hatred for Rykard her primary driver while maintaining her contempt for Brennis's complicity. The removal of the last name makes her feel more like a folk hero, a symbol rather than just a person.
