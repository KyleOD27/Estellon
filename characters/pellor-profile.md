## Core Identity: The Shadow Master

- **Driving Belief:** True power belongs to those intelligent enough to seize it from those too weak to wield it properly.
- **Core Motivation:** To control Estellon from the shadows, orchestrating events to place himself as the city's ultimate authority.
- **Greatest Strength:** Brilliant strategic mind combined with the perfect mask of humble servitude. Masters the art of seeming powerless.

---

## Personality & Demeanor

### In Public
The perfect picture of a humble, competent administrator. Deferential, helpful, and utterly forgettable. Always ready with solutions and never seeking credit.

### In Private
Cold, calculating, and brilliant. The mask drops to reveal a man who takes genuine pleasure in manipulation and control. His smile becomes something predatory.

### Physical Description
- **Build:** Average height, unremarkable build—designed to be forgotten
- **Face:** So thoroughly ordinary that even daily contacts struggle to remember his features
- **Hair:** Thinning brown streaked with grey, unfashionably styled
- **Eyes:** Pale green like pond water, constantly calculating behind wire-rimmed spectacles
- **Attire:** Impeccably clean and fitted clothes in deliberately muted colors
- **Hands:** Long-fingered and steady, never trembling even under pressure

### Relationships

- **Duke Valerius:** His perfect puppet. Pellor has made himself indispensable while keeping the Duke dependent and ignorant.
- **Captain Brennis:** Respects his competence but sees him as a useful tool to maintain order while he works behind the scenes.
- **Ser Elara:** Views her reformist ideals as dangerous but potentially useful for creating controlled opposition.
- **Kael:** Sees the revolutionary as both a threat and an opportunity—someone whose chaos can justify his own consolidation of power.
- **Gorok the Hillbreaker:** Secret ally. Has orchestrated deals with the bandit king to weaken the city's defenses.
- **Duke Theron:** Another chess piece in his larger game, someone he can manipulate into attacking when it serves his purposes.

## Roleplaying Notes

- **Speech:** Measured, deferential, and reasonable. Always sounds helpful and never memorable. Delivers terrible news in soothing tones.
- **Mannerisms:** Slight bow, stepping back to let others lead, adjusting spectacles, that warm but calculating smile
- **What He Values:** Control, information, secrets, appearing harmless while being deadly
- **What He Despises:** Those who see through his facade, being given direct orders, losing control of situations
- **The DM's Hook:** Pellor should appear helpful and competent until the great reveal. Players should trust him initially.

## Goals & Secrets

- **Short-Term Goal:** Maintain control over Duke Valerius while positioning himself to be the obvious choice when the Duke falls.
- **Long-Term Goal:** Rule Estellon as its "reluctant" new leader after orchestrating the downfall of all competing factions.
- **Secret Alliance:** Has been feeding information to both Gorok and Duke Theron, orchestrating the external threats.
- **The Master Plan:** Intends for the faction war to weaken all sides, then emerge as the "savior" who can restore order.
- **Hidden Resources:** Has accumulated wealth, blackmail material, and hidden allies throughout his long career.

## Powers & Abilities

### Administrative Mastery
- **Information Network:** Knows everything that happens in the palace and much of what happens in the city
- **Bureaucratic Control:** Can expedite or delay any official process, granting or denying permits, licenses, etc.
- **Financial Manipulation:** Controls the city's purse strings and can redirect funds as needed

### Magical Abilities (Enchantment Wizard)
- **Suggestion:** Can subtly influence people's decisions
- **Charm Person:** Makes targets see him as a trusted friend
- **Modify Memory:** Can alter recollections of conversations and events

## Campaign Role

**The Hidden Villain:** Pellor is the true antagonist of the campaign, though this isn't revealed until Act II or III. He appears as a helpful NPC initially.

**The Puppet Master:** Behind every crisis, every faction conflict, every external threat, Pellor's influence can be found pulling the strings.

**Boss Fight:** In Act III, after Gorok's defeat, players discover Pellor's treachery and must face him in a battle of wits and magic.

**The Reveal:** The moment players discover his betrayal should be shocking—the helpful administrator was the enemy all along.

## The Ultimate Mastermind

Lord Pellor represents the insidious corruption that grows in the shadows of weak leadership. He is not a tyrant who seizes power through force, but a parasite who hollows out institutions from within. His defeat represents not just the end of external threats, but the purging of the rot that made those threats possible in the first place.
