## The Barbarian's Truth

Gorok represents the return of primitive law when civilized law fails. He is what happens when society's protections crumble—not evil for its own sake, but the natural predator who emerges when the sheep dogs are asleep. In some ways, his brutal honesty about power and strength is less corrupting than the pretty lies told by those who claim to serve justice while serving only themselves.

He is, ultimately, a mirror held up to civilization: if you cannot defend your values through strength and will, then perhaps you don't deserve to keep them.
