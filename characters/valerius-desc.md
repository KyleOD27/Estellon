# Duke Valerius II

He sat slumped in the ornate chair that had once held his father's commanding presence, and the throne seemed to dwarf him—not physically, but in some indefinable way that made observers acutely aware they were witnessing the slow-motion collapse of a legacy. Duke Valerius II, at forty-three, bore the soft, doughy features of a man who had never known want, never faced genuine hardship, and had mistaken comfort for competence his entire life.

Where his father, Duke Reginald, had possessed the bearing of a born leader—broad shoulders that carried responsibility like a mantle, eyes that sparked with intelligence and decisive will—the son seemed to have inherited only the trappings of power without any of its substance. His face was pleasant enough in a forgettable way: round where his father's had been angular, pale where Reginald's had been weathered by sun and responsibility, weak where strength should have resided. His brown hair, thinning prematurely, was kept in the style fashionable a decade ago, as if he were perpetually trying to recapture some moment when the world had made more sense to him.

The fine clothes he wore—silks and velvets in deep burgundy and gold—hung on him like costumes on an actor who had forgotten his lines. Every garment was perfectly tailored, every jewel flawlessly cut, yet somehow the overall effect was less that of a duke and more that of a child playing dress-up in his father's wardrobe. His hands, soft and uncallused, bore rings that seemed too heavy for his fingers, and he had a nervous habit of twisting them when faced with decisions he was unprepared to make—which was, unfortunately, most of them.

His eyes were perhaps the most telling feature, pale blue like winter sky, but without any of winter's sharp clarity. They held the glazed look of someone who had spent years avoiding difficult truths, seeking refuge in wine and willful ignorance. When forced to focus on unpleasant realities—reports of unrest, complaints from the people, the increasingly dire state of the city's finances—those eyes would dart away like startled birds, seeking any excuse to look elsewhere, to be elsewhere, to be anyone else.

His voice, when he could be persuaded to use it for anything more substantial than pleasantries, carried the hesitant, questioning tone of someone perpetually seeking approval. Even his commands sounded like suggestions, his proclamations like requests for permission. He had learned, somewhere along the way, that it was easier to let others make the hard choices, easier to sign whatever papers Lord Pellor placed before him than to wrestle with their implications.

The courtiers and nobles who surrounded him had long since learned to speak around him rather than to him, conducting the real business of governance in whispered conferences while he nodded along, grateful to be included but terrified of being asked to contribute anything meaningful. He had become, in essence, a living seal—a warm body to legitimize decisions made by others, a face to put on policies he neither understood nor truly endorsed.

Yet there were moments—rare, fleeting, but unmistakable—when something of his father's bloodline would flicker behind those pale eyes. A flash of the man he might have been, had circumstances been different, had he been born with his father's steel spine instead of wishbone flexibility. In those moments, observers might catch a glimpse of genuine anguish, a recognition of how far he had fallen from the legacy he was meant to inherit.

He was not cruel, this failed duke—cruelty required too much decisiveness, too much commitment to a course of action. He was simply absent, a hollow man wearing the crown of a once-great city, presiding over its decay with the bewildered helplessness of someone who had never learned that power was not a privilege to be enjoyed but a responsibility to be borne. In the end, perhaps that was the greatest tragedy of all: not that he was evil, but that he was so thoroughly, devastatingly ordinary.
