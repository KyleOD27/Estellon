This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is "The Weight of the Crown," a new tabletop campaign experience in a similar style to D&D set in the city of Estellon. The repository contains campaign materials, character profiles, and story documentation for a political intrigue campaign focused on the theme of Law vs. Chaos.

The project scope is a wide creative berth, including the production of content, stories, narratives and game mechanics.

## Repository Structure

- `/characters/` - NPC profiles and descriptions (Kael, Elara, Brennis)
- `/game/` - Campaign mechanics and materials
- `/story/` - Act-by-act story content
  - `/act i/` - The Spark of Rebellion
  - `/act ii/` - The Faction War
  - `/act iii/` - The Siege
- `/assets/` - (Currently empty) For maps, images, and other visual materials

## Key Campaign Components

### Core NPCs
1. **Ser Elara Vance** - Lawful Good Orc Paladin, leads the Reformers
2. **Kael** - Chaotic Good Human Sorcerer, leads the Revolution
3. **Captain Brennis** - Lawful Neutral Human Fighter, maintains the Status Quo

### Game Mechanics

- **3-part campaign structure**: different aims and mechanics in each act, all leading to a final conclusion
- **Progress Tracks**: Revolutionary Zeal (0-10), City Control (0-10), Coalition Strength (0-10)
- **Faction Turn**: Narrative tool for off-screen faction actions
- **Leader Quest Chains**: 3-step personal quests for each faction leader
- **Dialogue Bingo Card**: Roleplaying incentive system

## Content Guidelines

When working with this campaign:
- Maintain consistency with established character personalities and motivations
- Preserve the central theme of Law vs. Chaos vs. Order
- Keep the three-faction dynamic balanced
- Ensure player agency remains central to the narrative

## File Formats

- Character profiles use `.md` and `.txt` formats
- Story content is in `.txt` format
